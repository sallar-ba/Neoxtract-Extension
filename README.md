## How It Works

1. **Auto-Injection**: The extension automatically injects the content script when needed
2. **Smart Retry**: Uses retry logic with fallback content script injection for reliability  
3. **Content Script**: The `content.js` file extracts link information from webpages
4. **Popup Interface**: The popup provides a user-friendly interface to view and interact with extracted links
5. **Message Passing**: The popup communicates with the content script using Chrome's messaging API

## Data Extracted

For each link, the extension extracts:
- **URL**: The full link URL
- **Text**: The visible link text
- **Type**: Internal or external classification
- **Domain**: The link's domain name
- **Visibility**: Whether the link is visible on the page

## Export Options

### 📄 JSON Export
- Downloads a comprehensive JSON file with all link data
- Includes metadata like export timestamp and total count
- Perfect for developers and data analysis

### 📊 Excel Export
- Downloads a formatted .xlsx file
- Organized in columns: URL, Text, Type, Domain, Visibility
- Optimized column widths for easy reading
- Compatible with Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet applications

### 📈 Google Sheets Export
- Downloads CSV file and opens Google Sheets in a new tab
- Follow the import wizard: File → Import → Upload → Select CSV file
- Automatically formats data for easy sharing and collaboration

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: This extension does not collect or store any personal data
- **Local Processing**: All link extraction happens locally in your browser
- **No Network Requests**: The extension doesn't send data to external servers
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions (activeTab, scripting, tabs for Google Sheets export)

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Fully supported (Manifest V3)
- **Edge**: Should work with Chromium-based Edge

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- The extension now auto-extracts links, so no manual action needed
- If it still doesn't work, try clicking "Refresh Links"
- Make sure you've enabled the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### No Links Found
- Some websites may load links dynamically via JavaScript
- Try clicking "Refresh Links" after the page has fully loaded
- The extension now automatically handles most timing issues

### Page Refresh Required (Fixed!)
- **This issue has been resolved!** You no longer need to refresh pages
- The extension automatically injects content scripts when needed

### Permission Issues
- The extension requires the "activeTab", "scripting", and "tabs" permissions
- Make sure you've granted necessary permissions during installation
